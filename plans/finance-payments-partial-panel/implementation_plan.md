# Implementation Plan

[Overview]
Display a computed Installment Plan panel within the Payments section of the Cashier Viewer that appears when the selected studentâ€™s registration paymentType is 'partial'. The panel must show the Down Payment and exactly five equal installment entries alongside the Payments box, using the already-available tuition breakdown payload.

This feature improves cashier visibility and guidance during payment posting for installment-paying students. It uses the existing tuition compute/saved payloads and registration context already loaded on the page, requires no backend changes, and follows existing AngularJS + Tailwind patterns used across the Cashier Viewer. The panel must render only when paymentType === 'partial' and when installments data exists in tuition summary.

[Types]  
No framework type system changes. We will use controller-local data shapes for clarity and safety.

- Existing payload from TuitionBreakdownResource:
  - Source: vm.tuitionPayload().summary.installments
  - Expected keys:
    - down_payment: number
    - installment_fee: number
    - total_installment: number

- Controller-local shapes (conceptual):
  - InstallmentPlanSummary:
    - dp: number                // from installments.down_payment
    - fee: number               // from installments.installment_fee
    - total: number             // from installments.total_installment
  - InstallmentPlanEntry:
    - key: 'dp' | 'i1' | 'i2' | 'i3' | 'i4' | 'i5'
    - label: 'Down Payment' | 'Installment N'
    - amount: number

Validation/assumptions:
- Render panel only if (registration.paymentType || edit.paymentType) === 'partial'
- Render panel only if tuitionPayload().summary.installments is present
- When available, amounts are parsed as floats; non-finite are treated as 0 only for display
- Exactly five installment entries (DP + 5x installments), as specified

[Files]
The feature modifies only the Cashier Viewer front-end.

- New files to be created:
  - None

- Existing files to be modified:
  - frontend/unity-spa/features/finance/cashier-viewer/cashier-viewer.controller.js
    - Provide or ensure presence of controller helpers:
      - vm.shouldShowInstallmentPanel(): boolean
      - vm.installmentsSummary(): InstallmentPlanSummary | null
      - vm.installmentsList(): InstallmentPlanEntry[] (DP + 5x installments)
    - Helpers must be safe against missing tuition/summary/installments, with no side effects.
    - Ensure recomputation hooks run whenever tuition/registration updates (e.g., after loads and option saves).

  - frontend/unity-spa/features/finance/cashier-viewer/cashier-viewer.html
    - In the Payments card body, render a right-hand Installment Plan panel using Tailwind classes.
    - Guard the panel with ng-if="vm.shouldShowInstallmentPanel()".
    - Content:
      - Down Payment amount
      - Exactly five installment items (equal amounts)
      - Footer card showing total_installment

- Files to be deleted or moved:
  - None

- Configuration updates:
  - None

[Functions]
Minimal, pure helpers exposed on vm for the template.

- New or ensured functions (frontend/unity-spa/features/finance/cashier-viewer/cashier-viewer.controller.js):
  - shouldShowInstallmentPanel(): boolean
    - Purpose: visible only when registration/edit paymentType is 'partial' and tuitionPayload().summary.installments exists.
    - Logic:
      - const pt = (vm.registration && vm.registration.paymentType) || vm.edit.paymentType || null;
      - if (pt !== 'partial') return false;
      - const p = vm.tuitionPayload(); return !!(p && p.summary && p.summary.installments);

  - installmentsSummary(): { dp:number, fee:number, total:number } | null
    - Purpose: map summary.installments fields to dp/fee/total or return null if not present.
    - Behavior: parseFloat; ignore non-finite by returning 0 at display-time only.

  - installmentsList(): InstallmentPlanEntry[]
    - Purpose: produce 6 entries: Down Payment + 5 equal installments (exactly five).
    - Behavior:
      - Use installmentsSummary() for dp/fee.
      - Return:
        - [{key:'dp', label:'Down Payment', amount:dp},
           {key:'i1', label:'Installment 1', amount:fee}, ... , {key:'i5', label:'Installment 5', amount:fee}]

- Modified functions:
  - _recomputeInstallmentsPanel(): If already present, ensure the internal precomputed UI model reflects DP + 5 installments and is called after tuition/registration changes.
  - refreshTuitionSummary(): Ensure it invokes installment recomputation hook after totals selection is resolved.

- Removed functions:
  - None

[Classes]
No classes involved (AngularJS controller is a function). All changes are controller-scoped helpers and view bindings.

- New classes: None
- Modified classes: None
- Removed classes: None

[Dependencies]
No additional dependencies required.

- Data dependencies: 
  - Registration: vm.registration.paymentType (or vm.edit.paymentType while editing)
  - Tuition payload: vm.tuitionPayload().summary.installments (from /tuition/compute and/or saved snapshot)
- No backend or package changes.

[Testing]
Manual UI validation using a Finance/Admin user.

- Preconditions:
  - A student and term selection that loads registration and tuition payloads
  - A registration row where paymentType is 'partial'
  - A tuition payload where summary.installments exists

- Test cases:
  1) paymentType = 'partial', installments present:
     - Installment Plan panel appears at the right of Payments box.
     - Down Payment amount displays and matches installments.down_payment.
     - Exactly 5 installment rows display; each equals installments.installment_fee.
     - Total Installment equals installments.total_installment.
  2) paymentType = 'full':
     - Installment Plan panel is hidden.
  3) Missing installments:
     - Installment Plan panel is hidden; no console errors.
  4) Saved vs computed:
     - Panel reflects whichever payload vm.tuitionPayload() currently returns (saved snapshot preferred).
  5) Regression:
     - Payments creation form and list are not affected.
     - Page remains responsive; panel stacks properly on small screens.

[Implementation Order]
Perform controller helper implementation first, then template wiring, then validate.

1. Controller: add/ensure vm.shouldShowInstallmentPanel, vm.installmentsSummary, vm.installmentsList; guard all data access defensively.
2. Controller: add/ensure vm._recomputeInstallmentsPanel integrates these helpers and is called after tuition/registration loads or updates.
3. Template: add/confirm the right-hand Installment Plan panel with ng-if="vm.shouldShowInstallmentPanel()".
4. Template: render amounts via number:2; use provided helpers; ensure exactly five installment rows.
5. Manual QA across partial vs full, with and without saved tuition payload, and responsive breakpoints to confirm layout and visibility rules.
