- [x] Step 5: Create AngularJS faculty.service.js (list/get/create/update/delete)
- [x] Step 6: Create AngularJS faculty.controller.js to manage list and edit flows
- [x] Step 7: Create AngularJS list.html and edit.html views with form validations
- [x] Step 8: Update core/routes.js to add admin.faculty and admin.faculty.edit states, guarded by role service
- [x] Step 9: Update sidebar to include Faculty menu visible only to admin

Notes:
- All write and detail endpoints must be protected by middleware('role:admin') using X-Faculty-ID header for dev context.
- Required fields align with legacy NOT NULL behavior: strMiddlename, strEmail, strMobileNumber, strAddress, strDepartment, strSchool.
- Password handling: hash strPass with bcrypt on create; on update only hash if provided, otherwise leave unchanged.
- Frontend visibility: Faculty menu and routes only visible/accessible to admin role.
