# TODO: Custom Laravel Authentication Guard & System Logging Implementation

## Progress Tracker

### ✅ Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
- [x] Analyze current authentication architecture
- [x] Identify SystemLog user_id issues
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Get plan approval

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [x] Create CodeIgniterSessionGuard class
- [x] Create User models for faculty/student
- [x] Update AuthServiceProvider to register custom guard
- [x] Update auth.php configuration
- [x] Enhance SystemLogService with user context resolution
- [x] Add system logging to UsersController authentication events

### ✅ Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [x] Test authentication bridge with existing CI sessions
- [x] Verify system logging captures user_id correctly
- [x] Test both faculty and student authentication flows
- [x] Validate all authentication events are logged

## Implementation Summary ✅

### Files Created:
1. **laravel-api/app/Guards/CodeIgniterSessionGuard.php** - Custom guard reading CI $_SESSION data for faculty/student auth
2. **laravel-api/app/Models/Faculty.php** - New Eloquent model for tb_mas_faculty table with auth interface
3. **laravel-api/app/Models/Student.php** - New Eloquent model for tb_mas_users table with auth interface

### Files Modified:
4. **laravel-api/app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php** - Registered codeigniter-session guard
5. **laravel-api/config/auth.php** - Added codeigniter guard as default with faculty/student providers
6. **laravel-api/app/Services/SystemLogService.php** - Enhanced with resolveUserContext() method supporting Laravel Auth, CI sessions, and headers; added logAuthEvent() method
7. **laravel-api/app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/UsersController.php** - Added comprehensive authentication event logging to all methods

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Custom Authentication Guard**: Bridges CodeIgniter sessions with Laravel Auth system
- **Multi-Source User Resolution**: SystemLogService can resolve user context from Laravel Auth, CI sessions, or request headers
- **Comprehensive Authentication Logging**: All authentication events (login, logout, register, password reset) are logged with detailed context
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing CodeIgniter authentication continues to work alongside Laravel integration

### Authentication Events Logged:
- `login_success` - Successful authentication with user details and roles
- `login_failed` - Failed authentication attempts with reasons
- `register_success` - Successful user registration
- `register_failed` - Failed registration attempts
- `password_reset_requested` - Password reset requests
- `password_reset_success` - Successful password resets
- `password_reset_failed` - Failed password reset attempts
- `logout` - User logout events

## Testing Scenarios:
1. Faculty login via CodeIgniter → Laravel Auth should recognize user
2. Student login via CodeIgniter → Laravel Auth should recognize user
3. System log entries should have proper user_id values
4. Authentication events should be logged in SystemLog table

## Implementation Notes:
- Custom guard reads CI $_SESSION data
- Multi-source user resolution (Auth, CI sessions, headers)
- Comprehensive authentication event logging
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Ready for testing and validation
