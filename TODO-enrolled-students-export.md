# TODO â€” Enrolled Students Export

Scope: Implement export to Excel for enrolled students for a selected term, exposed via GET /api/v1/reports/enrolled-students/export and add a new Registrar Reports page with an Export action. Enrollment filter: tb_mas_registration.intAYID = :syid AND r.intROG = 1. Program code: use registration.current_program if not null, else fallback to users.intProgramID.

Progress will be tracked by checking off steps as they are completed.
